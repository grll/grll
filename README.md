# Hi there, I'm Guillaume! 👋

I'm a data scientist specialized on NLP topics. My data & AI consulting job and various passioning projects had me explore many other fields: infra, clouds architecture, MLOPS, big data pipelines, machine learning, web development, ...

## 🔭 Current Projects

- **Languages**: Python, Typescript
- **Frameworks**: transformers, fastAPI, pydantic, nextjs...
