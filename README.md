# Hi there, I'm Guillaume! 👋

I'm a trained data scientist specialized on NLP leveraging the transformer architecture.

BUT during the past 15 years, I explored several aspects of software engineering:
* web / fullstack development while building an e-commerce website for a national tea company (among other)
* big data pipelines for risk and compliance department of large banks on pyspark / palantir foundry
* designing scalable LLM pipelines to answer questions on insurance contracts for a global insurance company.

Always curious to understand and do the work end-to-end incl. deploying on various cloud, setting up CI/CD...

Leveraging these diverse experiences, I am currently focusing on building a product: SubstantAI as co-founder and CTO.
